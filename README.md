# GeoGuessr Quizzes

This project aims to help getting familiar with GeoGuessr metas, especially subdivision names and area codes.

The actual reason why I started this project is that sometimes I just can't find websites for practice that meets my need, and I'm just annoyed with it :rage:.

This project will feature more customizable settings which will make learning faster (I suppose). This is the **WHOLE** point of doing all these.

## Setup

### Requirements
- Node.js 24.10.1
- npm (comes with Node)

### Install & Run
After cloning it and `cd` into the directory, run
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
and it should work.
